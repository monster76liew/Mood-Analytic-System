# Mood Analytic System

The **Mood Analytic System** is a framework for understanding how multiple factors — music, food, social context, and environment — interact to shape human mood.  
It goes beyond single-source mood trackers by integrating diverse inputs into a holistic emotional map.

## 🌱 Vision
Everyone has a personal "mood toolbox." This system helps translate experiences into structured insights:
- **Music**: rhythm, harmony, instrumentation, cultural cues
- **Food**: flavor, preparation, timing, social context
- **Social**: quality of interactions, support vs. stress
- **Environment**: lighting, noise, temperature, location type

The goal is to capture both **visible reasons** (tempo, flavor, social setting) and **invisible reasons** (personal resonance, cultural meaning) behind moods.

## 🎶 Modules

### 1. Music Analysis
- Tempo (BPM)
- Valence (happiness scale)
- Lyrics sentiment
- Instrumentation (acoustic/electronic, solo/ensemble)
- Harmony/Key (major/minor, dissonance/resolution)
- Dynamics (soft/loud passages)
- Cultural cues (genre origin, tradition vs. modern)
- Personal resonance tags (user-defined anchors, e.g. *Bali Run = motivation*)

### 2. Food & Nutrition
- Flavor profile (sweet, salty, bitter, spicy)
- Preparation method (home-cooked vs. fast food)
- Eating context (alone, family, social)
- Timing (morning vs. late night)

### 3. Social & Environment
- Social interaction quality (supportive vs. stressful)
- Environment cues (lighting, noise, temperature)
- Location type (home, office, outdoors)
- Cultural context (traditional vs. modern settings)

## 🧠 Integration Layer
- **Weighting system**: assign influence scores (e.g., music = 40%, food = 20%, social = 30%, environment = 10%)
- **Mood synthesis**: combine inputs into composite states (e.g., *energized but anxious*)
- **Pattern recognition**: detect recurring combinations over time
- **Narrative output**: generate short mood stories, e.g.  
  *“Today’s mood feels like running freely on a beach — energized by jazz fusion, grounded by a home-cooked meal, and uplifted by supportive conversation.”*

## 🤖 Future AI Enhancements
- Pattern recognition across datasets
- Personalized mood recommendations
- Predictive suggestions (e.g., “Jazz fusion + family dinner = calm motivation”)
- Creative narrative generation for emotional clarity
